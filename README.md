# File Encryptor Tool

## 🚀 Overview
The **File Encryptor Tool** is a lightweight and user-friendly desktop application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt multiple files at once, ensuring data security during transmission and storage. It uses XOR encryption and SHA-256 hashing for password protection, making it a secure and efficient solution.

## 🎯 How to Use
1. Open the application.
2. Select one or multiple files to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Enter a password (stored securely using SHA-256 hashing).
4. Click **Encrypt** to secure your files or **Decrypt** to restore them.
5. Toggle password visibility if needed.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- The password is never stored in plain text; it is hashed using SHA-256.
- Ensure you remember your password, as decryption without it is impossible.
- Always use strong and unique passwords for better security.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement biometric authentication for additional security.
- Integrate blockchain-based file verification.
